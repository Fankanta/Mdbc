Import-Module Mdbc
Set-StrictMode -Version 2

### Shared descriptions

$CollectionVariable = @'
Name of a new variable in the current scope with the connected collection. The
default variable name is Collection. The default variable is used implicitly by
cmdlets operating on collection data.
'@

$IdParameter = @'
The document _id value to be assigned or a script block returning this value
for the input object represented by the variable $_.

_id must not exist in input objects or be specified again by Property.
'@

$NewIdParameter = @'
Tells to generate and assign a new document _id as MongoDB.Bson.ObjectId.

_id must not exist in input objects or be specified again by Property.
'@

$ConvertParameter = @'
A script called on exceptions during conversion of unknown data to BsonValue.
The variable $_ is the problem object to be converted. The script returns a
single value to be tried instead or nothing for nulls.

Examples: {} converts unknown data to nulls. {"$_"} converts data to strings,
it is useful for preserving as much information as possible on dumping objects
for later analysis.

Converters should be used sparingly, normally with unknown or varying data.
Consider to use Property for selecting standard and converting not standard
known data.
'@

$PropertyParameter = @'
Specifies properties or keys which values are to be included into documents or
defines calculated fields. Missing input properties and keys are ignored.

Arguments are defined in three ways:

1. Strings define property or key names and the corresponding result document
field names.

2. Hashtables @{Key=Value} define renamed and calculated fields. The key is a
new document field name. The value is either a string (input object property
name) or a script block (field value calculated from the input object $_).

3. Hashtables @{Name=...; Expression=...} or @{Label=...; Expression=...} are
similar but use the same convention as the parameter Property of Select-Object.

See New-MdbcData examples.
'@

$CollectionParameter = @'
Collection object. It is obtained by Connect-Mdbc, Open-MdbcFile, or using the
driver methods, for example from a database instance. If it is not specified
then the variable Collection is used.
'@

$QueryTypes = @'
The following types are used as or converted to queries: IMongoQuery (created
by New-MdbcQuery), Mdbc.Dictionary, BsonDocument, JSON-like hashtables. Other
values are treated as _id and converted to _id queries.
'@

$QueryParameter = "Specifies documents to be processed. $QueryTypes"
$QueryParameterMandatory = @'
The parameter is mandatory and does not accept nulls. In order to specify all
documents use an empty query, e.g. @{}. Note that an empty string implies
@{_id=''}, not @{}.
'@

$AsParameter = @'
Specifies the representation of output documents. The argument is either a
required type or a shortcut enum value for special types.

A type specifies the output type literally. Type properties must match the
document fields or the custom type serialization must be registered.

Shortcuts, either enum values or strings:

	Default
		Default output, Mdbc.Dictionary with underlying BsonDocument.

	Lazy
		Mdbc.LazyDictionary with underlying LazyBsonDocument.
		Call Dispose() after use.

	Raw
		Mdbc.RawDictionary with underlying RawBsonDocument.
		Read only. Call Dispose() after use.

	PS
		PowerShell custom object.

By default result documents are represented by Mdbc.Dictionary with underlying
BsonDocument. See New-MdbcData for details. Use of its Lazy or Raw form may
improve performance in some cases.

In some scenarios other output types may be suitable like native .NET types
(-As ([Type])) and PowerShell custom objects (-As PS).

On choosing an output type keep in mind that Mdbc.Dictionary (BsonDocument)
field names are case sensitive unlike object properties in PowerShell.
'@

$SortByParameter = @'
Specifies sorting field names and directions. Values are either field names or
hashtables with single entries @{Field = <Boolean>}. $true and $false or their
equivalents are for ascending and descending sorting.
'@

$TypeWriteConcernResult = @{
	type = '[MongoDB.Driver.WriteConcernResult]'
	description = 'Result object from the driver is written if the switch Result is present.'
}

$AboutResultAndErrors = @'
In order to output command result objects from a server use the switch Result.

Depending on operations some server exceptions are caught and written as not
terminating errors, i.e. processing of remaining pipelined objects continues.

Parameters ErrorAction and variables $ErrorActionPreference are used to alter
error actions. See help about_CommonParameters and about_Preference_Variables.
'@

$DocumentInputs = @(
	@{
		type = '$null'
		description = @'
Null is converted to an empty document by New-MdbcData and ignored by
Add-MdbcData and Export-MdbcData.
'@
	}
	@{
		type = '[Mdbc.Dictionary]'
		description = @'
Objects created by New-MdbcData or obtained by Get-MdbcData or Import-MdbcData.
This type is the most effective and safe as input/output of Mdbc data cmdlets.

The native driver document [MongoDB.Bson.BsonDocument] can be used as well but
normally it should not be used directly. Its wrapper [Mdbc.Dictionary] is more
suitable in PowerShell.
'@
	}
	@{
		type = '[IDictionary]'
		description = @'
Dictionaries are converted to new documents. Keys are strings used as new field
names. Collection, dictionary, and custom object values are converted to BSON
container types recursively. Other values are converted to BsonValue.
'@
	}
	@{
		type = '[PSObject]'
		description = @'
Objects are converted to new documents. Property names are used as new field
names. Collection, dictionary, and custom object values are converted to BSON
container types recursively. Other values are converted to BsonValue.
'@
	}
)

$QueryInputs = @(
	@{
		type = '[MongoDB.Driver.IMongoQuery]'
		description = 'Query expression. See New-MdbcQuery (query).'
	}
	@{
		type = '[Mdbc.Dictionary]'
		description = @'
A document which _id is used for identification. Documents are created by
New-MdbcData or obtained by Get-MdbcData.
'@
	}
	@{
		type = '[object]'
		description = 'Other values are treated as requested _id values.'
	}
)

$FileFormatParameter = @'
Specifies the data file format:

 	Bson
 		BSON format

 	Json
 		JSON format

 	Auto (default)
 		The format is defined by the file extension: ".json" is for JSON,
 		other extensions are for BSON.

Input JSON is a sequence of objects and arrays of objects. Arrays are unrolled.
Top objects and arrays are optionally separated by spaces, tabs, and new lines.
'@

### Connect-Mdbc
@{
	command = 'Connect-Mdbc'
	synopsis = 'Connects a server, database, and collection.'
	description = @'
The cmdlet connects the specified server, database, and collection and creates
their reference variables in the current scope. With default names they are
Server, Database, and Collection.

The * used as a name tells to get all database names for a server or collection
names for a database.

If none of the parameters ConnectionString, DatabaseName, CollectionName is
specified then they are assumed to be ., test, test respectively.
'@

	parameters = @{
		ConnectionString = @'
	Connection string (see driver manuals for details):
	mongodb://[username:password@]hostname[:port][/[database][?options]]

	"." is used for the default driver connection.

	Examples:
		mongodb://localhost:27017
		mongodb://myaccount:mypass@remotehost.example.com/mydatabase
'@
		DatabaseName = 'Database name. * is used in order to get all database objects.'

### ADatabase
$ADatabase = @{
	parameters = @{

}

### New-MdbcData
@{
	command = 'New-MdbcData'
	synopsis = 'Creates data documents and some other driver types.'
	description = @'
This command is used to create one or more documents (input objects come from
the pipeline or as the first parameter InputObject) or a single BsonValue (by
the named parameter Value).

Created documents are used by Add-MdbcData and Export-MdbcData. These cmdlets
also have parameters Id, NewId, Convert, Property for making documents from
input objects. Thus, in some cases intermediate use of New-MdbcData is not
needed.

Mdbc.Dictionary

Result documents are returned as Mdbc.Dictionary objects. Mdbc.Dictionary holds
an underlying BsonDocument (Document()) and implements IDictionary. It works as
a hashtable where keys are case sensitive strings and input and output values
are convenient .NET types instead of underlying BsonValues. Main features:

Useful members:

	$dictionary.Count
	$dictionary.Contains('key')
	$dictionary.Add('key', 'value')
	$dictionary.Remove('key')
	$dictionary.Clear()

Setting values:

	$dictionary['key'] = ...
	$dictionary.key = ...

Getting values:

	.. = $dictionary['key']
	.. = $dictionary.key

NOTE: On getting values the form "$dictionary.key" fails in strict mode (see
Set-StrictMode) if the "key" is missing. The form "$dictionary['key'] is safe,
it returns null for a missing key. Use Contains() in order to check existence
of a key for sure.
'@
	parameters = @{
		InputObject = @'
.NET object to be converted to Mdbc.Dictionary, PowerShell friendly wrapper of
BsonDocument. Objects suitable for conversion are dictionaries, custom objects,
and complex .NET types, normally not collections.
'@
		Id = $IdParameter
		NewId = $NewIdParameter
		Convert = $ConvertParameter
		Property = $PropertyParameter
		Value = @'
An object to be converted to a BsonValue.

Cmdlets and helper types do not need BsonValue's, they convert everything
themselves. But BsonValue's may be needed for calling driver methods directly.

Containers:

	[IDictionary] is converted to BsonDocument.
	[IEnumerable] is converted to BsonArray.

Primitives:

	[bool]     is converted to BsonBoolean.
	[DateTime] is converted to BsonDateTime.
	[double]   is converted to BsonDouble.
	[Guid]     is converted to BsonBinaryData (and retrieved back as [Guid]).
	[int]      is converted to BsonInt32.
	[long]     is converted to BsonInt64.
	[string]   is converted to BsonString.

If a primitive type is known than it is much more effective to create it
directly than by this cmdlet, e.g. for a string:

	[MongoDB.Bson.BsonString]'Some text'

### New-MdbcQuery
$OneArgumentAndOr = @'
One argument can be used as well. For a previously created query it creates the
same query. But it can be used for creating a query from other supported input
types like hashtables.
'@
@{
	command = 'New-MdbcQuery'
	synopsis = 'Creates a query expression for other commands.'
	description = @'
The cmdlet creates a query expression used by Get-MdbcData, Remove-MdbcData,

### New-MdbcUpdate
@{
	command = 'New-MdbcUpdate'
	synopsis = 'Creates an update expression for Update-MdbcData.'
	description = @'
This cmdlet creates update expressions used by Update-MdbcData. Parameters are
named after driver update builder methods. They can be combined in order to
create complex updates in a single call.

Some parameters (Unset, PopFirst, PopLast) require only field names (String[]).
Example:

	New-MdbcUpdate -Unset field1 -PopLast field2, field3

Other parameters require field names and associated arguments. Such parameters
accept one or more hashtables (IDictionary). Each hashtable defines field names
as keys and arguments as their values. The following commands are essentially
the same:

	# Two hashtables with single entries
	New-MdbcUpdate -Set @{field1 = value1}, @{field2 = value2}

	# One hashtable with two entries
	New-MdbcUpdate -Set @{
		field1 = value1
		field2 = value2
	}
'@
	parameters = @{
		AddToSet = @'
Adds a value to an array only if the value is not in the array already.

If a field argument is a collection then it is treated as a single value to
add. Use AddToSetEach in order to add each value.

Mongo: { $addToSet: { field: <addition> }
'@
		AddToSetEach = @'
Adds values to an array only if the values are not in the array already.

Mongo: { $addToSet: { field: { $each: [ <value1>, <value2> ... ] } } }
'@
		BitwiseAnd = @'
Performs bitwise AND update of integer values (int or long).

Mongo: { $bit: { field: { and: NumberInt(5) } } }
'@
		BitwiseOr = @'
Performs bitwise OR update of integer values (int or long).

Mongo: { $bit: { field: { or: NumberInt(5) } } }
'@
		BitwiseXor = @'
Performs bitwise XOR update of integer values (int or long).

Mongo: { $bit: { field: { xor: NumberInt(5) } } }
'@
		Inc = @'
Increments a field by a specified number. If a field does not exist, it adds
the field and sets it to the specified value. It accepts positive and negative
values (int, long, or double).

Mongo: { $inc: { field: <number> } }
'@
		Mul = @'
Multiplies a field by a specified number. The field to update must contain a
numeric value. If the field does not exist, it creates the field and sets the
value to zero of the same numeric type as the multiplier.

Mongo: { $mul: { field: <number> } }
'@
		Min = @'
The $min updates the value of the field to a specified value if the specified
value is less than the current value of the field. If the field does not
exists, the $min operator sets the field to the specified value. The $min
operator can compare values of different types, using the BSON comparison
order.

Mongo: { $min: { field: <value> } }
'@
		Max = @'
The $max operator updates the value of the field to a specified value if the
specified value is greater than the current value of the field. If the field
does not exists, the $max operator sets the field to the specified value. The
$max operator can compare values of different types, using the BSON comparison
order.

Mongo: { $max: { field: <value> } }
'@
		PopFirst = @'
Removes the first element in an array.

It fails if a field is not an array. When it removes the last remaining item
a field holds an empty array.

Mongo: { $pop: { field: -1 } }
'@
		PopLast = @'
Removes the last element in an array.

It fails if a field is not an array. When it removes the last remaining item
a field holds an empty array.

Mongo: { $pop: { field: 1 } }
'@
		Pull = @"
Removes matching values from a field if it is an array. It fails if a field is
present but it is not an array.

If a field argument is a collection then it is treated as a single value to
pull. Use PullAll in order to remove each value.

If a field argument is a query expression than items matching the expression
are removed. $QueryTypes

Mongo: { `$pull: { field: <value>|<query> } }
"@
		PullAll = @'
Removes multiple values from an existing array. PullAll provides the inverse
operation of PushAll.

Mongo: { $pullAll: { field: [ value1, value2, ... ] } }
'@
		Push = @'
Appends a value to a field if it is an existing array, otherwise sets a field
to an array with one value. It fails if a field is present but it is not an
array.

If a field argument is a collection then it is treated as a single value to
push. Use PushAll in order to push all values.

Mongo: { $push: { field: <value> }
'@
		PushAll = @'
Appends all values to an array.

Mongo: { $push: { field: { $each: [ value1, valu2 ... ] } } }
'@
		Rename = @'
Renames a field. A field argument is a new field name.

Mongo: { $rename: { <old name1>: <new name1> }, ... }
'@
		Set = @'
Sets a field value. This parameter name can be omitted in a command, i.e. these
commands are the same:

	New-MdbcUpdate @{field = value}

	New-MdbcUpdate -Set @{field = value}

Mongo: { $set: { field1: <value1>, ... } }
'@
		SetOnInsert = @'
Sets a field value on adding a new document during update. It has no effect on
updates that modify existing documents.

Mongo: { $setOnInsert: { field1: <value1>, ... } }
'@
		Unset = @'
Tells to remove a field from an existing document.

Mongo: { $unset: { field1: "", ... } }
'@
		CurrentDate = @'
The $currentDate operator sets the value of a field to the current date.

Mongo: { $currentDate: { field: true } }
'@

Either the name of a command with no arguments or one argument or a JSON-like
hashtable that defines a more complex command, for example:

	Invoke-MdbcCommand @{create='test'; capped=$true; size=1kb; max=5 }

If the element order in a command is important then hashtables may not work.
Use Mdbc.Dictionary instead:

Name of the output database, used together with Collection.
By default the database of the input collection is used.
'@
		OutMode = @'
Specifies the output mode, used together with Collection. The default value is

}
@{
	command = 'Export-MdbcData'
	synopsis = 'Exports objects to a BSON file.'
	description = @'
The cmdlet writes BSON representation of input objects to the specified file.
The output file has the same format as .bson files produced by mongodump.exe.

Cmdlets Export-MdbcData and Import-MdbcData do not need any database connection
or even MongoDB installed. They are used for file based object persistence on
their own.

Files created by Export-MdbcData may be opened as collections by Open-MdbcFile
with some caveats. Documents should not contain invalid names *.* and $*. If
documents do not have unique _id's then the switch Simple should be used.
'@
	parameters = @{
		Path = @'
Specifies the path to the file where BSON representation of objects will be stored.
'@
		Append = 'Tells to append data to the file if it exists.'
		InputObject = 'Document or a similar object, see INPUTS.'
		Id = $IdParameter
		NewId = $NewIdParameter
		Convert = $ConvertParameter
		Property = $PropertyParameter
		FileFormat = $FileFormatParameter
		Retry = @'
Tells to retry on failures to open the file and specifies one or two arguments.
The first is the retry timeout. The second is the retry interval, the default
is 50 milliseconds.

### Import-MdbcData
@{
	command = 'Import-MdbcData'
	synopsis = 'Imports data from a file.'
	description = @'
The cmdlet reads data from a BSON file. Such files are produced, for example,
by the cmdlet Export-MdbcData or by the utility mongodump.exe.

Cmdlets Export-MdbcData and Import-MdbcData do not need any database connection
or even MongoDB installed. They are used for file based object persistence on
their own.
'@
	parameters = @{
		Path = @'
Specifies the path to the BSON file where objects will be restored from.
'@
		As = $AsParameter
		FileFormat = $FileFormatParameter
	}

	outputs = @(
		@{
			type = '[Mdbc.Dictionary]'
			description = 'Default, Lazy, or Raw form depending on the parameter As.'

### Open-MdbcFile
$OpenSaveExample = @{
	code = {
		# Open existing or new bson file collection
		Open-MdbcFile data.bson

		# Use Get-MdbcData, Add-MdbcData, Remove-MdbcData, Update-MdbcData

		# Save data
		Save-MdbcFile
	}
}
@{
	command = 'Open-MdbcFile'
	synopsis = 'Opens a bson file as a collection.'
	description = @'
This cmdlet opens a bson file as a collection for operations Get-MdbcData,
Add-MdbcData, Remove-MdbcData, and Update-MdbcData. Save-MdbcFile is used in
order to save data to the source file or another file. Such scenarios do not
require MongoDB running or even installed.

NORMAL AND SIMPLE DATA

In the normal mode which is the default documents in a file must have unique
_id's. If new documents have no _id's then they are generated on insertions.

The simple mode is specified by the switch Simple. Presence and uniqueness of
document _id's is not maintained. Operations like Add-MdbcData -Update are not
supported.

INVALID ELEMENT NAMES

Document element names like *.* and $* are invalid in collections because query
and update expressions use the dot notation for nested items and special names
$* for operators.

Nevertheless Open-MdbcFile does not perform name checks on reading assuming
that the file was created and maintained only by cmdlets listed above and it
contains valid names.

Remember that files created in a different way, for example by Export-MdbcData,
may contain problematic names for using them as collections with Open-MdbcFile.
'@
	parameters = @{
		Path = @'
Specifies the bson file path. If the file does not exists then the collection
is empty and the file is not created until it is saved. If the path is omitted
or empty then the collection is empty and Save-MdbcFile will require a path.
'@
		Simple = @'
Tells to operate on simple data, i.e. do not maintain presence and uniqueness
of document _id's. Some operations like Add-MdbcData -Update are not supported.
'@
		NewCollection = @'
Tells to open an empty collection. If the source file path is specified then it
is simply stored for saving, the source file is not touched at this moment.
'@
		CollectionVariable = $CollectionVariable
		FileFormat = $FileFormatParameter
	}

	examples = $OpenSaveExample, @{code={
	# Open and query data produced by ConvertTo-Json (PowerShell V3)

### Save-MdbcFile
@{

	synopsis = 'Saves data to a bson file.'
	description = @'
This cmdlet saves the collection data to the specified or the original file.
'@
	parameters = @{
		Collection = @'
Collection object created by Open-MdbcFile. If it is omitted then the variable
Collection is used which is assumed to be created by Open-MdbcFile by default.

It is not an error to call this cmdlet for a native driver collection. Such a
call is simply ignored.
'@
		Path = @'
Specifies the bson file path for saving data. If it is omitted or empty then
the path used on opening is assumed. If it was not provided as well then an
error is thrown.
'@
		FileFormat = $FileFormatParameter, @'
This parameter is ignored if the path is omitted or empty.
